I expected it to be able to detect differences in toxicity based on tone. My theory for this low accuracy, and the API’s bias regarding language toxicity as a whole, is that it isn’t great at picking up on context. I believe that it looks at the specific words and their most common usage to determine toxicity; for example, profanity is commonly used in toxic language, so statements that include it are likely to be flagged as toxic. However, this indicates that non-toxic statements using profanity and such language could be falsely flagged as toxic, which is reflected in the results. The other side of the coin for the API focusing more on words rather than the context in which they are used is that when users find ways to use circumventive language that obscures profane words and the like, the API can easily be fooled by the lack of harsh words due to its relative inability to pick up on human context.\n",
